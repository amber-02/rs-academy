things that need to be done:

Navbar:
- get the nav bar elements on the left side of the nav bar
- get the buttons in the right side looking like the design 
- get the logo in the middle of the nav bar (and maybe slightly bigger)

Use cases we need to implement:  << this needs to be checked and changed
1. log in
2. sign up?
3. view courses?
4. homepage? view overview?
5. different pages?
6. posting on forum

NAVBAR REARRANGED ... BUT still needs fixing as there's lots of padding, margins etc. which are relative to each other
- try making it a clearer structure so we know where each section/box actually is instead of moving until looks alright (which i do
and then unsure if it's centeredXD)

ADDED LINK TO RSA AT TOP - brings you back to the homepage
added RS logo to top of page, but it is on the left side of the page
 - dev tools say this is because of a margin on the right side

fixed resizing navbar issue
fixed dimension on right of navbar

----------------------------------------------------------------
TO BE DONE:
- sign in in hamburger menu isn't in the right place - should be in line, at the bottom of the menu
- Hamburger menu should disappear when something on the menu is clicked
- font of logo in navbar needs to be bold
- 'contact us' page graphic needs to be centered
----------------------------------------------------------------
RESOLVED:
- Real Support Academy written at the top of all pages is waaaaaay too big and messes up resizing of navbar - also it looks bad
- hamburger menu doesn't show up as soon as the navbar items disappear
- location of hamburger (too high, needs to be moved down)
----------------------------------------------------------------
