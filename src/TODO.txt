things that need to be done:

Navbar:
- get the nav bar elements on the left side of the nav bar
- get the buttons in the right side looking like the design 
- get the logo in the middle of the nav bar (and maybe slightly bigger)

Use cases we need to implement:  << this needs to be checked and changed
1. log in
2. sign up?
3. view courses?
4. homepage? view overview?
5. different pages?
6. --

NAVBAR REARRANGED ... BUT still needs fixing as there's lots of padding, margins etc. which are relative to each other
- try making it a clearer structure so we know where each section/box actually is instead of moving until looks alright (which i do
and then unsure if it's centeredXD)

ADDED LINK TO RSA AT TOP - brings you back to the homepage
added RS logo to top of page, but it is on the left side of the page
 - dev tools say this is because of a margin on the right side

tile is overflowing
fixed dimension on right of navbar



 implement react-router-dom for different pages
