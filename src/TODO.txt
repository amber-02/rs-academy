TO BE DONE:

*********
HOMEPAGE:
*********

- create a carousel for all of the graphics to rotate around
    - use cards and maybe bootstrap

*******
NAVBAR:
*******

- Hamburger menu should disappear when something on the menu is clicked


*******
SIGNIN:
*******

- when the username/password text box is clicked, the title should move to the top: 
i think this is done with the css using the <label> tag

- when sign up as student is clicked, there is a prompt to enter username and password - they 
should be able to sign up like how it looks on sign up as teacher


************
ADD COURSES:
************

- text added should be white
- length in weeks option should be a drop down menu
- when submitting, the fields should clear
- form allows submit on empty fields - set all to 'required'
- course description box can be moved to next to method of teaching section - will look much better
- teaching method should be on form when submitting new course -- RESOLVED

**************
VIEW COURSES:
**************

- make text in top row of table bold
- sort out overflow of table
